      <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous
      proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are
      large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth
      modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct.
      Only two genera,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant "
        ><em>Loxodonta</em>
      </a>
      (African elephants) and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephas"><em>Elephas</em> </a>
      (Asian elephants), are living. The family was first described by John
      Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the
      order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to
      include or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.
